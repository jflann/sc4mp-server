            <h4>Readme &bull; Version 0.1.0</h4>		
            <br>
            <p>Thank you for downloading SC4MP Server! This readme will help you get started setting up your server. It's recommended that you be already familiar with the SC4MP Launcher before proeceeding.</p>

        <h2>Getting started</h2>
            <h3>Installation</h3>
            <p>SC4MP Server can be installed to any directory of your choosing.</p>
            <h3>Running your server</h3>
            <p>Run the executable named "sc4mpserver.exe", and the server will start in a console window. A subdirectory named "_SC4MP" will be created in your install directory which contains all the files pertaining to the functioning of your server. The server will begin listening for connections. Close the console window to shutdown the server.</p>
            <h3>Testing your server</h3>
            <p>With the server executable running, launch the SC4MP Launcher and open the direct connect window. Enter the host "localhost" and the default port 7240. Once connected to your server, you should see the default regions in-game. Close the game whenever you'd like. In the future you may use the hostname "localhost" and the server's port whenever you'd like to connect to the server running on your current machine.</p>
            <h3>Adding plugins and regions</h3>
            <p>Plugins and regions can simply be dragged-and-dropped into the "Plugins" and "Regions" subdirectories in the "_SC4MP" subdirectory of your installation directory. Changes should only be made to your server's plugins and regions when the server is not running. You may also delete the default plugins and regions if you'd like; however, it's best to keep the default plugins as they improve multiplayer gameplay.</p>
            <p>Please do <b>NOT</b> use plugins and regions without the expressed permission of their original creators! Many developers do not like their plugins and regions obtained through sources other than their official pages, so please consider the wishes of the original authors when choosing your plugins and regions.</p>
